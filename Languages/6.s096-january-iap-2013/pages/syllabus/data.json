You will learn the required background knowledge, including memory management, pointers, preprocessor macros, object-oriented programming, and how to find bugs when you inevitably use any of those incorrectly. There will be daily assignments and a small-scale individual project.\nSoftware Standard Environment It\u0026rsquo;s most efficient for the staff if everyone uses the same environment:\nAthena command-line Compiling: gcc, g++ Debugging: gdb, valgrind Editing: nano, pico, vim, or emacs You can mimic that environment on your own computer:\nWindows: All the necessary packages (except valgrind) are available in cygwin (gcc-core, gcc-g++, gdb). OS X: Install Xcode from the App Store, open it, go to Preferences \u0026gt; Downloads \u0026gt; Components and download \u0026ldquo;Command Line Tools\u0026rdquo;. Linux: sudo apt-get install build-essential or equivalent. IDEs If you\u0026rsquo;d like to use a GUI instead (and there are many good reasons to do so), we\u0026rsquo;ll try to help you out, but:\nYour programs still need to work in the standard environment, so you should test them there. One of our primary debugging tools (valgrind) may not be available in your IDE. Nevertheless, these IDEs seem to work well:\nCode::Blocks (Windows, Linux, OS X) Eclipse (Windows, Linux, OS X) Visual Studio (Windows) Xcode (OS X) "}
